# Hat Finder Game

This project is a simple browser-based game where the player navigates through a field to find a hat while avoiding holes. The game is implemented in JavaScript and updates the game board dynamically on a webpage.

## Project Description

The Hat Finder Game involves a player starting at a random position on a field. The objective is to navigate through the field and find the hat (`🎩`) while avoiding holes (`O`). The player's path is marked with `*` and the rest of the field is filled with `░`. The game provides an option to play in a harder mode where additional holes are added to the field.
